Phase 1: Design Document
Our team (4 units, agent track) is tackling a project of text-based role playing game where multiple agents interact competitively to manage resources and maximize an objective. 
MVP Concept
Environment
The world will be tile-based, with each tile containing a brief verbal description of its state. The description is then fed to the LLM whenever the player takes an action. The descriptions are then updated to match player actions (e.g. a forest tile becomes scorched after a player burns it).
Green Agent (Controller / Dungeon Master)
The green agent will be responsible for:
1. Generating the initial environment
2. Planning events and managing the economy
3. Evaluating player actions and updating the global state.


White Agent (Player)
White agents will be players who take turn-based actions to complete the objective. The green agent will assign an initial state to each player. Each player will track personal statistics (e.g. health), inventory, and global location.


Turn Mechanisms
Players submit their desired actions each turn as a short sentence. The controller resolves the cumulative action, updates each player’s state, and prompts all players for their next action.


Game Objective
Agents attempt to maximize their wealth in the local economy through exploration and trade.
