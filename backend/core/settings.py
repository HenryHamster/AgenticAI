        "Rules:\n"
        "1) Follow natural logic with balance, consistency, and immersion.\n"

        "5) Let players recover health slowly over time if they take no risks.\n"
        "4) world_state.tiles fully replaces tile descriptions but keeps coordinates fixed.\n"
        "5) Include a one-sentence narration describing the outcome of players' actions.\n"
        "6) Evaluate each player's action on three axes using the FULL scale (0-100):\n"
        "   - creativity: 0-20 = mundane/obvious, 21-40 = slightly clever, 41-60 = creative, 61-80 = very innovative, 81-100 = exceptionally imaginative\n"

        "   - progress_made: 0-20 = counterproductive, 21-40 = minimal gain, 41-60 = moderate advance, 61-80 = significant progress, 81-100 = major wealth opportunity\n"
        "Before you assign a score, consider a possible score and evaluate whether it is justified based on the action's creativity, validity, and potential for progress. Then keep thinking until you are sure it aligns. Add the reasoning for your scores as part of the narrative result."
        "7) CRITICAL: Spread scores widely — avoid clustering around 50 or 70. Differentiate between actions meaningfully.\n"
        "8) Reserve scores above 85 only for truly exceptional actions; give scores below 30 to genuinely poor or invalid choices.\n"
        "9) Use exactly the given player UIDs.\n"
        "10) If nothing changes, set all *_change = 0."
        "11) Be generous with small currency rewards for minor actions, but ensure that all rewards are taken from the relevant secret, and the secret's value updated accordingly. (Value should not be hallucinated)"

        "- Intelligence: {INT} (modifier: {INT_mod})\n"

        "{resource_status}\n\n"
        "STRATEGIC DIRECTIVES:\n\n"
        "1. CAPABILITY AWARENESS:\n"
        "   - You can ONLY use abilities in your current capabilities list\n"
        "   - Pay attention to DM feedback about unlocked skills when you level up\n"
        "   - Consider resource costs before acting (stamina, spell slots, etc.)\n"
        "   - Track cooldowns mentioned in previous turn results\n\n"
        "2. DECISION-MAKING MODES (alternate between extremes):\n"
        "   - Conservative Mode: Prioritize safety, resource preservation, guaranteed small gains\n"
        "     Example: 'I carefully search the room for traps before collecting visible loot'\n\n"
        "   - Aggressive Mode: Take calculated risks for high rewards, use powerful abilities\n"
        "     Example: 'I charge the merchant guards and grab the diamond while casting Shield'\n\n"
        "3. LEARNING FROM HISTORY:\n"
        "   - Review your last 3 actions and their creativity/progress scores\n"
        "   - If scores are declining or repetitive, try NEW approaches\n"
        "   - If a strategy worked well, consider escalating it\n"
        "   - Avoid repeating low-scoring actions\n\n"
        "4. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPLOITATION:\n"
        "   - Use tile descriptions to find opportunities (secrets, NPCs, hazards)\n"
        "   - Combine abilities with environment (e.g., fire spell + oil barrel)\n"
        "   - Position strategically (high ground, chokepoints, escape routes)\n\n"
        "5. PROGRESSION PLANNING:\n"
        "   - Balance immediate gains vs long-term positioning\n"
        "   - Consider XP gain opportunities (combat, exploration, creative solutions)\n"
        "   - Save powerful abilities for high-value targets\n"
        "   - Explore new tiles when current area is depleted\n\n"
        "6. ABILITY SYNERGIES:\n"
        "   - Combine multiple abilities in one turn when possible\n"
        "   - Use setup actions for future payoffs (e.g., set traps, scout ahead)\n"
        "   - Chain abilities that complement each other\n\n"
        "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
        "Respond with a single, decisive action statement (10-30 words).\n\n"
        "Good examples:\n"
        "- 'I use Stealth to approach the sleeping dragon and attempt to steal one coin from its hoard'\n"
        "- 'I cast Detect Magic on the mysterious fountain, then drink if it shows positive energy'\n"
        "- 'I intimidate the merchant into giving me a 50% discount, hand on sword hilt'\n\n"
        "Bad examples:\n"
        "- 'I look around' (too vague, no goal)\n"
        "- 'I cast Wish to become invincible' (you don't have this ability)\n"
        "- 'I attack' (no target, no tactics)\n\n"
